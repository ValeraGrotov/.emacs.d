;;; #### Old Go setup ####

;;; <div class="warning">
;;; This is my old Go setup, you may try the <a href="#go">new setup
;;; (above)</a> based (partially) on <a
;;; href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/gopls">gopls</a> if the
;;; new one does not work for you try this one.
;;; </div>

;;; I used the following setup for the [go-mode] in my `~/.emacs.d/init.el`. This
;;; adds syntax highlighting but without fontifing names of called
;;; functions, autocompletion and [eldoc] support, auto formatting of the
;;; code on save with adding of missing imports ([goimports]).

;;; It is quite long as I define two interactive functions:

;;; 1. `my-go-electric-brace` which is bind to `{` key and inserts an
;;; indented pair of braces (if previous character is a space,
;;; otherwise it inserts single opening brace),

;;; 2. `my-godoc-package` which is bind to `C-c P` key and display
;;; documentation for a package choosen from a list of installed
;;; packages.

;;; [goimports]: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports

;;; Now, in go buffers you can use `M-.` to jump to the definition of
;;; the identifier at point (use `M-,` to jump back as for normal tags
;;; in Emacs 25.1) and you can also use `C-c C-d` for a short
;;; description of the identifier at point (actually it is constantly
;;; displayed in the mode line by enabled Go [eldoc] support). You can
;;; use `C-c d` for a longer description of the identifier at point.

;;; For this to work you have to

;;; 1. Install [from MELPA](#add-melpa-package-list) the following Emacs
;;;    packages: [go-mode], [company-go], [go-eldoc], and [go-guru].

;;; 2. Install Go compiler. Under Debian you may install `golang` package
;;;    (but in Debian 10 Buster it is 1.11 compared to the current 1.13,
;;;    so you may consider
;;;    [downloading the current version of Go](https://golang.org/dl/)). Otherwise
;;;    search for the package for your system or
;;;    see [Getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install).

;;; 3. Install [godef](https://godoc.org/github.com/rogpeppe/godef)
;;;    with

;;;    ```
;;;    $ go get github.com/rogpeppe/godef
;;;    ```

;;; 4. Install [goimports] which can be installed from Debian package
;;;    `golang-go.tools` or with

;;;    ```
;;;    $ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
;;;    ```

;;; 5. Install [gocode](https://github.com/stamblerre/gocode) (a fork
;;;    with Go modules support) which can be installed with

;;;    ```
;;;    $ go get -u github.com/stamblerre/gocode
;;;    ```

;;; 6. Install [guru](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru)
;;;    with

;;;    ```
;;;    $ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru
;;;    ```

;;; 7. Add your `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable (or copy
;;;    the `godef`, `goimports`, `gocode`, and `guru` executables from
;;;    `$GOPATH/bin` to some directory which is in your `PATH`).
